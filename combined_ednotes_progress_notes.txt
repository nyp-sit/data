Seen by GRM Edify team in EDTC ward and discharged (see CDOCs entry). Now referred by GP and brought in for functional decline and right hip pain. History from patient and patient's husband somewhat different, and patient's husband claims that patient has a very poor memory and is sometimes confused. Patient's husband reports that patient has been complaining of right hip/buttock pain for the past 1 week. It was not present when patient was in EDTC. For the past few days, patient's maid and himself had to transfer/lift her and she would be screaming in pain. Largely bed/chair-bound due to pain, not keen to do much. Appetite decreased. No fever/respy/urinary symptoms. Did not appear to have back pain. PU BO normal. No new trauma. Patient herself says that she already had slight right hip pain when she was in EDTC, but it only became very bad a few days after discharge. Somewhat inconsistent wrt what precipitates the pain - patient says slight pain on walking and severe pain on sitting. Patient's husband's earlier account is different -> severe pain on walking and therefore not walking much.

A left infraclavicular dual-lead pacemaker is noted; the leads are intact. Evidence of prior CABG (midline sternotomy with mediastinal clips) is noted. No consolidation or pleural effusion is seen. The heart size cannot be accurately assessed due to the AP projection. Diffuse osteoblastic foci are noted in the visualized bones. XR, Shoulder, Right (AP+Lateral) of 27-APR-2018: No fracture is detected. There is superior subluxation of the humeral head, which suggests a rotator cuff tendinopathy. The acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) is intact. XR, Lumbosacral Spine, AP and Lateral of 27-APR-2018: Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4-L5 is noted. There is decreased intervertebral disk space between L4-L5, L5-S1. The lumbar lordosis, vertebral body heights are largely preserved. Lumbar spondylosis is noted in the form of marginal osteophytes. Both of the sacroiliac joints and psoas outlines are unremarkable. XR, Pelvis, AP of 27-APR-2018: XR, Hip, Right of 27-APR-2018: Phleboliths are noted in the pelvis. The pelvic ring is intact. No fracture or hip dislocation is detected. Bilateral sacroiliac joints are intact. Diffuse osteoblastic foci are noted in the visualized bones. XR, Femur, Right of 27-APR-2018: No fracture or dislocation is detected. The bony alignment is intact. XR, Knee, Right of 27-APR-2018: Severe tricompartmental degenerative changes of the knee are noted in the form of marginal osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and loss of joint space. This is worst in the medial tibiofemoral compartment. A large knee effusion is noted. Deformity of the fibula neck may be sequelae of prior trauma. COMMENTS Diffuse osteoblastic/sclerotic foci are seen in the visualised ribs, in the axial skeleton, pelvis. Prostatic bony metastasis should be a consideration. Suggest clinical correlation and further evaluation to look for a underlying cause. No definite displaced fracture is noted.
